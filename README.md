# George's Halloween

This is George.

George loves Halloween. üéÉ

By the way, today is the big day. He leaves all happy in his disguise in search of candy! üç¨

On the way to the harvest, he comes across an adorable cat. A fan of felines, he cannot ignore this little animal. üêà That's why he rushes after him to cuddle him (or get scratched as you choose). 

Too concentrated in pursuit, he does not realize that he has engulfed himself in a mansion with many rooms. So, good luck getting George out of this mansion :)

During this project, I discovered the agile method by making this game during a 2-week sprint and concluding with a retrospective. I learned to work in a team, in particular by doing mob programming and pair programming.
